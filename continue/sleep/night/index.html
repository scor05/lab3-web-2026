					You decide to go ahead and ask your friends if they want to play with whatever both Marcus
                    and his uncle decided to install on the cabin. To the left of the living room you found a table for 
                    table tennis, foosball and another table for beer pong, telling you that it was going to be a very
                    occupied night. <br><br>

                    Josh brought a bottle of tequila and a bottle of whiskey, daring you to a game of table tennis with two
                    shots of each for the loser. There were already some beers in the house Marcus already left the previous
                    day, which you guys used for the beer pong. All that you can remember is accepting Josh's deal and getting
                    absolutely curb stomped, then everything else was a blur. <br><br>

                    You then wake up, feeling absolutely wasted by the hangover you inflicted upon yourself. You look at the
                    clock next to you, it marks only 8:03 AM, which surprises you a little given how much you believe you drank
                    the night befre. <br><br>

                    You also start to feel very hungry. <br>
