                    You turn the doorknob, realizing that it is very easy to open and the wall just kind
                    of tears apart, allowing you to go through <br><br>

                    Stepping through the door, you notice a very long flight of stairs. You think to yourself:
                    "I already broke the house's wall, might aswell just commit to checking this out". <small>bad decision</small> <br><br>

                    After a very long time, you eventually find a door. It is very tall, made entirely out of wood and has
                    a big X marked on it. Your curiosity gets the better of you and you decide to open it. <br><br>

                    Inside you see him. <br><br>

                    You see it all. <br><br>

                    There's no escaping his grasp. <br><br>

                    It drives you mad. <br><br>

                    With whatever willpower you have left, you run back up the stairs, through the hallway, to the porch
                    and then to your car. You luckily had your keys in you, so you start it up and run away. <br><br>

                    Driving out of the forest you realize you don't have much time left, so you grab a six pack that was
                    left in the passenger seat and put it on the pedal, to keep the car going away from him. <br><br>

                    You grab a pen in your shirt, and a piece of paper from the receipt of the six pack. <br><br>

                    You faint. <br><br>
