                    Heading over to the kitchen, you see all of your friends perfectly seated around a circular table,
                    leaving the chair closest to you empty. You ask them: "morning guys, ¿yall ate anything yet?", but
                    they don't respond at all. <br><br>

                    Looking back at the table you see a very nice meal: some scrambled eggs with bacon and beans next to 
                    them. Thinking nothing of your friends' behaviour, you turn left towards the fridge to grab a refreshing
                    beer (you guys forgot to actually bring real drinks, nice), but as you turn back you hear a loud <strong>CRACK</strong>
                    as you see all of your friends' necks SNAP towards you, now looking at you with fully white eyes. <br><br>

                    You freeze, thinking that this is all a hallucination, but after wiping your face multiple times and
                    smacking yourself hoping to wake up, nothing changes. After what feels like an eternity, they all say
                    in unison: <br><br>

                    <details>
                        <summary>???</summary>
                        <strong>
                        GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT <br>
                        GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT <br>
                        GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT <br>
                        </strong>

                        <p>
                            Still engulfed in fear, you say "of course I do, you guys are my childhood friends". However,
                            upon thinking about it further, you don't really have any memories of them. It is all just
                            blank. <br><br>

                            Before you can even utter another sentence, they all jump at you and tackle you to the ground,
                            after which, it's all dark
                        </p>
                    </details>
                </p>
