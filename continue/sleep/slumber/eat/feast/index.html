                    You decide to head towards the kitchen to look for some leftovers (you're too lazy to actually
                    cook a meal), but on the hallway you notice a weird outline around the door, almost like a perfect
                    rectangle that once had a door in it. You never actually took the time to look at this hallway
                    properly, so you do also notice a very small horizontal piece of metal pertruding out of the wall.
                    When you tried to touch it and push it your hand caved into the wall a bit, revealing that the wall 
                    is really just a thick paper cover and you feel a spherical object, which you soon realize to be a doorknob. <br><br>

                    What do you do?
