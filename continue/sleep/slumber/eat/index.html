                    You tell your friends that you are too tired to play, but that you might want to the next day. You
                    head over upstairs to the dorms and into the bed you made when you got to the cabin. After just a mere
                    few minutes you find yourself knocked out cold <br><br>

                    <details>

                        <summary>Wake</summary>
                        However, in the middle of the night, you wake up randomly and the WHOLE HOUSE IS ON FIRE. <br><br>

                        You panick and get up as fast as you can out of your bed and run towards the window and try to open it,
                        but it doesn't budge. You yell for help and for your friends, no one comes but one black human figure you spot
                        outside the cabin.<br><br>

                        You blink and the figure is now standing behind you, it quickly grabs you by the shoulders and screams multiple
                        times:<br><br>

                        <strong>
                        THEY ARE NOT REAL<br>
                        THEY ARE NOT REAL <br>
                        THEY ARE NOT REAL <br>
                        THEY ARE NOT REAL <br>
                        THEY ARE NOT REAL <br>
                        THEY ARE NOT REAL <br>
                        THEY ARE NOT REAL <br>
                        THEY ARE NOT REAL <br> <br>
                        </strong>

                        After that, the entity teleports you to the main hallway and points to one of the walls before doing the gesture
                        of opening a doorknob and suddenly phasing through the wall. <br><br>

                        Suddenly, you wake up and realize all you saw just now was a nightmare, even if it seemed vivid enough to
                        pass off as real life. The clock by your nightstand reads 8:03 AM, and you feel hungry. <br><br>

                        What do you do?

                        <ul>

                        </ul>
