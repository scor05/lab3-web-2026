					You continue into the forest, feeling a little uneasy about what could be happening to your car, but
                    you continue nonetheless. Soon enough, you arrive at the cabin and start unpacking all of your luggage,
                    one bag at a time. After you finish getting everything out of the car and into the cabin, the day has
                    almost fully passed, your watch marking 7:14 PM. You now have some spare time, what do you decide to do?
