	<h1>A Horror? Adventure</h1>
	<p>
		This is an adventure in which you try to break all of the horror stereotypes of constantly
		picking the worst possible decision to do at every moment, for example: going to the basement
		when clearly there's something wrong, going back to the house after escaping, falling over when
		running away, and (astonishingly??) many more. <br><br>

		HOWEVER, there is a catch (of course there is a catch, otherwise this adventure would end in like 2 seconds),
		your character has been possessed by the evil supreme demon of hell
