				This is an adventure in which you will experience a trip to the woods gone wrong with your friends in a
				a choose-your-own-adventure format, where you will be presented with links to navigate to whatever
				choice you decide to make along the way (beware of the consequences). <br><br>

				Throughout this adventure, an unknown entity has left 3 codes marked with certain
				letters and numbers that, when assembled the correct way, will form a code that will reveal a deep secret
				hidden in a safe box that was just in your car for some reason. The only way to find these codes is by getting every 
				good ending of the story.<br><br>

				The story begins with you and your friends Marcus, Josh and Sophie going on a road trip to Marcus' uncle's
				cabin
				located in the woods in your brand new 2020 Porsche 911 Cabriolet (absolute beauty of a car). While driving
				there, you pass by a
				mechanic shop and a gas station right next to each other, but you pay no mind to them as your gas tank is at
				more than half
				capacity (the trip took about a quarter your gas tank so far) and you guys bought snacks for the travel. As
				soon as
				you enter the forest with the cabin, you notice the check engine light turn on and the car starts making a
				faint
				unusual clanking noise whenever you switch gears.

				What do you do?
