				<p>
					This is an adventure in which you try to break all of the classic horror stereotypes of constantly
					picking the worst possible decision to do at every moment to try and escape a groundhog-day-inspired adventure.
					This is a choose-your-own-adventure type of game, where you will be presented with links to navigate to whatever
					choice you decide to make along the way (beware of the consequences). <br><br>

					HOWEVER, there is a catch (of course there is a catch, otherwise this adventure would end in like 2 seconds),
					your character has been trapped by a demon in a time loop of the adventure, and you are being forced to relive
					the entire story over and over again. Fortunately for you, an unknown entity has decided to help you by leaving
					codes marked with certain letters and numbers that (when assembled the correct way) will form a code that will
					end the story and break the time loop. The only way to find these codes is by getting every good ending of the
					story, avoiding possible traps from the demon.<br><br>

					The story begins with you and your friends (Marcus, Josh and Sophie) going on a road trip to Marcus' uncle's cabin
					located in the woods in your brand new Porsche 911 (absolute beauty of a car). While driving there, you pass by a 
					mechanic shop and a gas station right next to each other, but you pay no mind to them as your gas tank is at half 
					capacity (the trip took about a quarter your gas tank so far) and you guys bought snacks for the travel. As soon as 
					you enter the forest with the cabin, you notice the check engine light turn on and the car starts making a faint
					unusual clanking noise whenever you switch gears.

					What do you do?
