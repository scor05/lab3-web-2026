                    This is a report of the incidents recorded by a Puma gas station CCTV camera on the
                    <time datetime="2025-10-28T8:24">28th of October at 8:24 AM</time>: <br><br>

                    A Porsche car with smoke coming out of the engine stops next to the gas pumps,
                    with an unidentifiable person walking out of the car and towards the entrance of the store.
                    Just before going in, they frantically write in a piece of paper before collapsing onto
                    the pavement. Upon closer analysis and AI upscaling of the piece of paper dropped right beside
                    the person, it was determined that the words "THE KING IS HERE" were written with black ink and
                    in all uppercase.<br><br>

                    At <time datetime="2025-10-28T8:27">8:27 AM</time> three other unidentifiable people appear
                    to walk to the unconscious person and two of them begin to drag the unconscious body back to the direction
                    of where the car came from. The third person grabbed the piece of paper from the floor, before
                    the camera's feed cut to said person now standing before the camera. The feed cut out again after that, and
                    the whole scene disappeared, the car and everyone else were now gone. The hard drive in which the logs
                    from the gas station's CCTV footage is stored was also reported missing. <small>(until now)</smalL> <br><br>

                Thanks for reading through my short story, it was heavily inspired by Robert W. Chambers' "King in Yellow" book,
                and by the Youtube content creator Wifies' video titled "Searching for a World that Doesn't Exist". Highly
                recommend to read/watch both of those resources.
