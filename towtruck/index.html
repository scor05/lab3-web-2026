					Congratulations! You took the easy way out and just avoided all of the turmoil you would've
                    had to face if you kept going into the cabin! You didn't know if the car was going to make it
                    back home, so you played it safe and now got your first ending. <br><br>

                    This ending is mainly here just to show you how ending screens look like (star emoji on the title), 
                    and what you can expect for the rest of the adventure. Navigate with the options below to return 
                    to the start.
